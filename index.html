        <p>
          Art has always been a quiet passion of mine. It's a place where I can explore my feelings, my imagination, and the beauty of being imperfect.  I enjoy expressing things that words can't, whether it's through sketches, digital art, or things I make on the spot.  Each piece of art is a reflection of a moment, a feeling, or a memory, made with care and curiosity.  Here is a carefully chosen selection of my work that is for sale and ready to find a new home. (**NOTE** - none of this art is mine, i am not into art but for the sake of this website i have taken some dummy art.)
